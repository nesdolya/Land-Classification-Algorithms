# Land-Classification-Algorithms
## UVic Interdisciplinary Project 2019- BSc Major Combined Geography and Computer Science
Author: Andrea Nesdoly

Supervisor: Neil Ernst

This project evaluates different land classification algorithms by comparing three different machine learning techniques. Comparisons of time and space efficiency, analysis of accuracy compared to known software, and statistical tests will be conducted.
The remote sensing data being used comes from Sentinel 2A and covers the region of the Saanich Peninsula.

To run the enclosed Jupyter Notebook ensure that the machine being used has Python 3, and the following libraries are installed:
 - numpy
 - gdal
 - matplotlib
 - cv2
